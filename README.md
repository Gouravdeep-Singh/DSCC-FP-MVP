# Project Overview

In this project, we will be working with Financial Planet (FP), a major financial company based in Montreal. FP specializes in offering financial consultations to clients interested in investing in the stock market. They have approached Data Science Consultation Company (DSCC) to incorporate AI/ML capabilities into their services to provide AI-backed investment advice to their clients. The objective is to help FP compete effectively with other firms in the market that are already offering similar services. 

To demonstrate our capabilities to FP, we will be creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that showcases the key components of a data science solution. The MVP will enable us to collect, store, manipulate, explore, visualize, and analyze financial data, ultimately providing valuable insights that will be summarized in a comprehensive report.

# Project Requirements

The MVP should include the following components:  

1. **Data Collection**: We will collect financial data using APIs. Ensure that the data sources are reliable and up-to-date.  

2. **Data Storage**: Store the collected data in databases or data sources. You can consider options such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, or object storage services like AWS S3.   

3. **Data Loading**: Develop a mechanism to load data from the chosen storage solution into the data processing environment.  

4. **Data Manipulation**: Perform data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, correcting errors in data, and identifying anomalies.  

5. **Data Exploration**: Utilize data exploration techniques to gain insights into the dataset. This may include statistical summaries, distributions, correlations, and more.  

6. **Data Visualization**: Create meaningful visualizations to help stakeholders understand the data better. Use tools like matplotlib, seaborn, or interactive visualization libraries if needed.  

7. **AI/ML or Statistical Analysis**: Apply AI/ML algorithms or statistical techniques to derive valuable insights from the data. This could involve text summarization, and clustering, depending on the project's objectives.

8. **Report Generation**: Conclude the project by generating a comprehensive report. The report should contain the results of the analysis, insights, recommendations, and any other relevant details. It should be well-structured and easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand.



# Setting up the Workspace

**Task Management Tool**: Trello will be used for managing project tasks and milestones. 

**Source Code Management Tool**: GitHub is the chosen platform for source code management and collaboration.  

**Programming Language(s)**: Python will be the primary programming language for developing the MVP. Along with HTML, CSS and Javascript for developing the web application  

**Programming Libraries**: Pandas, matplotlib and other relevant data science libraries will be used for data manipulation and analysis.  

**Data Science Approaches**: We plan to explore various data science approaches such as clustering, trend analysis and other statistical and machine learning techniques depending on the project's requirements.  

**Databases**: The specific databases to be used will be determined based on data sources, but options such as MySQL, and MongoDB are under consideration.  

**Data Storage**: Cloud Object Storage solutions such as AWS S3 will be considered for data storage depending on scalability and cost-effectiveness.  

This foundation will enable us to effectively manage and develop the Financial Planet (FP) Data Science MVP Project, ensuring that we meet FP's requirements for demonstrating our data science capabilities.
